# Savy

The main objective of the project was to create software that enables a laptop to act as a server to which multiple clients (other laptops/mobiles) can connect. In our project, SAVY, we'll be implementing multimedia streaming using socket programming.

For that we’ll be using our laptops to stream audio and video files to our Android devices, i.e. mobiles or even other laptops in addition to accessing documents. The medium of transferring data is Wi-Fi. 

The project was based on the theme that multiple clients can access data from single server laptop on request and after closing the application there will be no trace of data that was accessed on clients’ device to maintain security and avoid duplicate copies, thereby lessening the memory requirements in clients’ system.
